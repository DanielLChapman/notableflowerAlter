Website Template
=================

This is a free CSS template found here : http://www.freecsstemplates.org/preview/notableflower/ that I wanted to play around with.

The first commit will be all the code from the freecsstemplates webpage, and will then be transformed into a jekyll blog site with altered CSS and javscript added in.

If freecsstemplates wishes for me to take this down, please send me a message, I do not mean to harm copyrights, I liked the design and wanted to play around with the set-up.

Thanks,
Have a good day.
